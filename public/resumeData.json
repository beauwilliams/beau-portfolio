My family tells me that when I was a little boy there were only ever two things I would ask for, 'can I have a bikkie' and 'can I play on the compooter'. I'm trying not to get too comfortable in any specific language or technology stack, but to develop routines that allow me to freely move from one to the next with ease.",

By taking a jack of all trades position my goal here is to implement processes and strategies I have learnt over the years during my short career - such as modernising how we communicate, how we manage information internally, ensuring data is handled correctly, maintaining an exceptional level of customer service as a company and managing customer feedback on the platform so that improvments are made in line with their expectations."

My proudest achievement is taking a best trick prize at an Australian street competition. I was invited to teach the children scooter lessons at Northern Beaches Christian School for their school sport. I had so much fun doing it, and was great to help them learn new tricks and have a great afternoon doing it. Overall this is my first experience being paid to coach kids, and I realised quickly it can be a lot harder than it seems! I took advice from the experienced skateboarding coaches and watched how they do it and eventually found my rhythm. Best thing about this job is it gave me time to focus on pivoting back to a technical field during 2019."
